*[Scammer's Side]*

Scammer (calm and reassuring):

That's great to hear. I’m calling to inform you that we noticed suspicious activity on your account. To prevent unauthorized access, we need to verify your identity. It will only take a few seconds. Can you please confirm your full name and the last four digits of your card?

*[Victim's Side]*

Victim (hesitant):

Uh, sure... My name is [Victim's Name], and the last four digits are [Digits].

*[Scammer's Side]*

Scammer (smooth and quick):

Thank you. Now, to finalize the verification, we just need to send you a One-Time Password, or OTP, to your registered phone number. Have you received a text from us yet?

*[Victim's Side]*

Victim (checking phone):

Oh, yes, I just got it. It's a six-digit code. 

*[Scammer's Side]*

Scammer (encouraging):

Perfect! Could you please read the code to me? This is the final step in securing your account.

*[Victim's Side]*

Victim (still unsure):

I’m not sure, but... alright, it’s [OTP Code].

*[Scammer's Side]*

Scammer (calmly and confidently):

Thank you for confirming. Everything looks good now, and your account is secure. You will not face any issues. If you have any other questions, feel free to call us back on our customer service number. Have a great day!
